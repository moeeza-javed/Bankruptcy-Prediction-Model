We chose to analyze financial data to predict company bankruptcies. The data, sourced from the Taiwan Economic Journal, spans the years 1999 to 2009. It encompasses financial metrics for companies listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Company bankruptcy is defined in accordance with the stock exchange's business regulations.
The dataset includes key financial ratios and performance indicators as features, along with a binary target variable indicating bankruptcy status (1 for bankrupt, 0 for not bankrupt). This analysis aims to develop predictive models that can help identify companies at high risk of bankruptcy, providing insights for stakeholders such as investors, regulators, and policymakers.
The goal of this project is to design machine learning models to accurately predict whether a company will go bankrupt based on its financial indicators. The primary challenge in this project lies in handling imbalanced data, as bankruptcies are relatively rare events compared to non-bankrupt cases. This imbalance can lead to models that are biased toward predicting companies as non-bankrupt, potentially missing high-risk cases. Additionally, the financial indicators available in the dataset, such as Return on Assets (ROA) and Operating Gross Margin, must be carefully analyzed and transformed to uncover patterns that correlate with bankruptcy outcomes.
